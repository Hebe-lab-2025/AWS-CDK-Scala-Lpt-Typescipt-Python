```In this Cloud Lab, 
you will practice with different AWS compute services, 
starting with EC2. 

You will create a security group to allow access to your EC2 instance and run a react application on the Instance. 
Then, you will create a role and then create and test a lambda function. 
Further, you will create a private repository on Amazon ECR to store your Docker image. 

Next, you will use the EC2 instance to build your Docker image before pushing it to your ECR repository. 

Once the Docker image is successfully uploaded to ECR, you create an ECS cluster and task definition. 

After that, you will define a task for your cluster by registering a task definition and specifying the Docker image and the resources required to run the container. 

Lastly, you will run the task on the ECS cluster, which will deploy the containerized application.

By the end of this Cloud Lab, 
you will have mastered AWS compute services and learned to create an EC2 instance, Lambda function, ECR repository, building a Docker image, 
and running a task on an ECS cluster. 

These skills are essential to master AWS compute services and ensure the smooth deployment of your applications on AWS compute services.
