# ✅ 模拟面试题参考答案（高分英文）

## 🟢 Q1

**How would you redesign a single-instance web application to be highly available and scalable?**

**Answer**

> I would start by eliminating single points of failure.
> I would place an Application Load Balancer in front of multiple EC2 instances running in an Auto Scaling Group across multiple Availability Zones so the web tier can scale horizontally.
> I would introduce SQS between the web tier and the worker tier to decouple components and handle burst traffic asynchronously.
> For the database, I would use RDS Multi-AZ to provide automatic failover.
> Finally, I would add AWS WAF in front of the ALB for security protection.
> This architecture improves scalability, availability, and fault tolerance while reducing tight coupling.

## 🟢 Q2

**Explain synchronous vs asynchronous communication**

**Answer**

> In synchronous communication, the caller waits for the response before continuing.
> This is simple but tightly coupled, and failures can cascade.
> In asynchronous communication, the caller sends a message to a queue and continues processing without waiting.
> This allows components to be decoupled, improves resilience, and handles burst traffic, but the result is not immediate and requires idempotent design.

一句话总结：

* synchronous = wait
* asynchronous = queue then continue

## 🟢 Q3

**How does SQS help protect downstream systems during traffic spikes?**

**Answer**

> SQS acts as a buffer between producers and consumers.
> When traffic spikes, messages accumulate in the queue instead of overwhelming downstream systems.
> Workers pull messages at a controlled rate, which smooths traffic, prevents overload, and increases resilience.
> It also provides durability, retries, and DLQs to prevent data loss.

## 🟢 Q4

**When would you choose Multi-AZ RDS versus Read Replicas?**

**Answer**

> Multi-AZ is primarily for high availability and automatic failover for write workloads.
> Read replicas are mainly for scaling read traffic.
> Multi-AZ = HA
> Read replica = read scalability
> They can be used together when both availability and high read throughput are required.

---

## 🟢 Q5

**Why is decoupling important in cloud architecture design?**

**Answer**

> Decoupling reduces dependencies between services.
> It prevents cascading failures, allows teams to scale components independently, and improves resilience.
> It also makes systems easier to evolve, deploy, and maintain.
> In AWS, decoupling is commonly implemented using SQS, SNS, and event-driven architectures.
